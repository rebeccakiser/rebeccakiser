Well hello there! 

I’m Becca and I am a third-year transfer student at Christopher Newport University studying Communications and minoring in Digital Humanities. I live off-campus in **Smithfield, VA** where I grew up, so if you’re ever looking for a quaint, small-town Main Street kind of situation, I can help you out. 

I want to work in writing and media in whatever avenue becomes available to me, but I have a huge heart for ministry so I would love to write in that context. Over the summer I had the privilege of interning at my church in their media/communications department and then I was officially invited onto the team as a paid employee last week. So I currently work as the copywriter and creative support specialist at [Community Church](https://community.church/) located in Western Branch and Suffolk, VA and it’s the most fun job ever! Because writing for social media is something I’ve just started doing professionally, I’m hoping this class will only improve my writing skills, particularly writing for online platforms.

For the past two years I have worked as a manager at a **non-profit coffee shop** in Chesapeake, VA called [Gather](https://gathercafe.net/). Over that time, I grew a massive love for coffee in all it’s fabulous forms. When I’m not in class, I’m most likely sipping on something caffeinated and pretending to be doing school work in my favorite coffee shop. This Fall has already brought so many wonderful changes so I’m excited to see what this semester has to offer!
