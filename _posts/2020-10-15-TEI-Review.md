# TEI Review

I recently encoded column 2 of page 655 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s short story, “The Yellow Wall-paper.” The text itself reads easy and captures the reader’s attention as they try to snoop around inside the mind of the author as she writes this peculiar story. Although the narrative itself is interesting, translating it to TEI was a challenge. As a newcomer to TEI (Text Coding Initiative), I was overwhelmed by the new terminology. For example, syntax is a string of text which represents characters and formatting commands to the computer, a toll I was not previously familiar with. After thorough explanation from my professor and the simplified coding process used in Oxygen, a processing system to aid in TEI coding, the project lost its intimidation factor.

Before we began coding in Oxygen, we used Google Docs to more simply annotate the text, bringing attention to the things that would require specific syntax once written for TEI. We used Google Docs to add comments for new paragraph lines, italic text, images, and em-dashes all of which would require special attention later. This step in the process eased my hesitancy about translating what seemed to be such a large amount of text into a language I do not speak. Once we began translating the text into XML (eXtensible Markup Language) within the Oxygen processing program, the process was streamlined with the assistance of a catalog of syntax which represent the modifications such as italic text and em-dashes.

The program itself, Oxygen, is strikingly easy to use despite the foreign language of TEI and its overwhelming appearance. As modifications are made to the code, a green tile indicates that the computer understands what you are trying to communicate. If at any time something is added incorrectly, the tile turns red and an alert appears to try to point out where the problem is. Once I began to look closely at the TEI code, it became clear that TEI is simply telling the computer exactly what we want it to do. Once I was able to understand the general basis of the system, the whole process was much simpler. The only challenge I encountered was when I started to encode the italic text. It took some digging for me to understand how to open and close tabs, which contain the code so that the computer has specific instructions. After playing around in Oxygen for a bit, I figured out what works. 
I found it very useful that we can save files as XML files which can be opened directly into processing software. My experience with Adobe Photoshop helped me make sense of this. In Photoshop, projects can be saved as a .PSD file which allows anyone to open and edit the project directly in photoshop just as the original creator built it. I discovered that .XML files are very similar. This makes it easy for each creator in this project to communicate freely and exchange sections of the text easily, which, in a project like this one, is imperative. 
Overall, this project was much simpler than I expected and definitely increased my enthusiasm for learning to code. The text was a great choice for this introductory project since it has plenty of em-dashes, page breaks, and italic text to practice using syntax. This was a great project and I am excited to continue learning about TEI and XML.
