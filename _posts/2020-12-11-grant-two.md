# Grant Post Two

As I near the end of my Grant Proposal and tie up all the loose ends, I have been made more and more aware of how labor-intensive a project of this magnitude can be. Overall, there was expansive research required for each aspect of the project and I was continuously challenged to find new ways to make my project come to life. Although I started the project with big dreams for what I wanted to accomplish, I quickly discovered that time, man-power, and money are all finite resources that stood in the way of bringing every detail of my initial design to pass. 

I was initially inspired by this site based on the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling.

I admired how it was able to captivate children’s attention, bring the pages of the book to life by means of technology, and instill a life-long love of reading in a global audience of young people. I immediately wanted to create the same for Wilder’s books while adding and expanding on the educational factors and influences of her text. In an increasingly online world, especially during a global pandemic, I can think of no better way to inspire a love for learning and history than to digitize her timeless classics in an engaging and interactive way. 

The aspect of the proposal that took me the longest to produce was the budget because I continually ran into roadblocks in identifying specific price points for what I wanted to produce without actually producing it. Often, once I did identify a price point, it was significantly higher than what I was able to propose in my budget, which then forced me to start my search all over again. This process required me to cut a great deal of my original plan and add it instead to a detailed plan for a second phase of the project. 

Something that hasn’t changed since the beginning is the need I see for a project like mine, as I had rather simply outlined in my Environmental Scan. That being said, wiring the Environmental Scan was much simpler than I had anticipated having had no experience, or even awareness, of such a document. The idea behind it, however, has helped me formulate research proposals for other courses and I believe will prepare me well for producing both professional and academic proposals in the future. 
Overall, this was an eye-opening project that I believe will prepare me well for future proposals and projects in a variety of fields.
