This project, “Prohibition: An Interactive History” is a website driven by the Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement and features articles, virtual artifacts, and interactive maps to paint the picture of the 1920’s Prohibition in the United States. Upon arriving at the home page of the website, my eyes are both significantly overwhelmed and captivated by the volume and detail of the content. Animated images and a cohesive timeline running along the bottom of the screen create a bounty of visual stimulation. It seems as though the website organizes content into categories of the Prohibition including, speakeasies, mass organized crime, and the women’s rights movement. Within just seconds of exploring the homepage, it is obvious that this study is as cohesive as possible from the early days of the Prohibition until it was lifted. 

The home page guides the reader through the timeline of the Prohibition, offering an enticing image and a teaser caption to introduce each topic. There are three different timeline options that display the same information which is a bit misleading. While the introductory slides of each topic are helpful in deciding which topic sparks my interest the most, the page itself is so visually stimulating that I’m not quite sure where to direct my attention.

When I click through to any particular topic, there is a massive block of text bordered by a handful of pictures. Despite being interested by the cover image and introductory text, I now feel invaded by information as a page full of small-print text stares back at me. Breaking down the information into slides of both images and text would have been a much less intimidating and more comprehensive avenue by which to display the information. The images present are all properly cited and captioned adequately, however, when I open up some of the articles, I can see the full versions of the cover images, some of which are poorly framed on the homepage.

The last page of the website features an interactive map of the US which allows you to click through each state to find the current alcohol laws. Although this is interesting information I wasn’t necessarily aware of, especially after learning about the laws during the Prohibition, the delivery of the information is a little unclear in this section. Each state is rated one to five bottles as very dry, dry, middle of the road, wet, and very wet, but the explanation of the meaning of each is absent. After comparing the laws of multiple states, it becomes clear that states that have the most accessibility to alcohol are rated as very wet while those with the strictest laws are very dry. While sorting through these states, I wondered if this information was updated to reflect the current alcohol laws as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be helpful to know when the map was last updated. 

Overall, I found this to be a fascinating projected packed full of information. This site could easily be an excellent resource for someone conducting research on this topic or who was simply curious about this time period. The website design could stand to be simplified and graphically reorganized to provide a more streamlined experience for the audience.
