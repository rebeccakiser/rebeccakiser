For my grant proposal, I will bring Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House books to life in the 21st century. The autobiographies depict Wilder’s childhood as her family moved from their log-cabin home in Wisconsin to live a pioneer life on the plains of Kansas and provide a captivating story of what life was like for many American children during the late 1800s. Her classic books are beloved by children across the nation and the passion for both reading and history they instill can only be heightened by an interactive online experience. I will be creating an exciting and engaging website where children will encounter Wilder’s stories in new light to inspire a life-long love for learning and reading. 
	I’ll be using features like an interactive timeline of her life, video chapter readings by various authors, and games involving the skills and experiences Wilder describes. All features of the website will be inspired by Wilder’s text while maintaining all authenticity possible. 
	While researching other Digital Humanities projects similar to this one, I found a large gap between engaging children’s resources and educational ones based on historical literature. In an age where technology is sweeping the minds of our youth, it is more important now than ever to cultivate a love for reading. For this project, I aim to combine the engaging qualities of some highly popular children’s sites with the educational content of others to create an immersive experience of Wilder’s books. 
	I was able to find a variety of successful children’s sites to gather inspiration. Looking ahead to writing a budget for this project, I’m finding that this project likely won’t be exhaustive in nature by means of my proposal, but will likely need to be completed in phases. As my research progresses, I am finding more ideas and resources to bring my project to life, but I am also finding that each of these ideas, while amazing in execution, will cost a lot to produce. The interactive features, detailed graphics, and video chapter readings will be very costly to produce. In the pursuit of excellence, I will create an outline of multiple phases for producing this project but will focus on the first phase for the purposes of this proposal. 
	Overall, I am really excited about how this project is unfolding. Although I have no experience with creating a budget for a project this size, I embrace the challenge. I look forward to writing the narrative once I have investigated the cost and determined exactly what I will propose.
